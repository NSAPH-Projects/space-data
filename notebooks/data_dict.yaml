      This data contains broadband usage information at the ZCTA (zipcode) level from
      Microsoft's [USBroadband Dataset](https://github.com/microsoft/USBroadbandUsagePercentages)
      at the zip code (ZCTA) level for the year 2020. Data from the 2020 Census is used
      to provide demographic and socioeconomic information at the ZCTA level.

  overview: 
    "Description": > 
      The data is sourced at high spatial resolution of 1km x 1km. 
      After merging multiple sources and removing missing values, the dataset contains around 5,000,000 observations.
      This dataset contains estimates of PM2.5 and of PM2.5 components for the contiguous United States at 1km resolution. 
      The components are: EC (Elemental Carbon), NH4 (Ammonium), NO3 (Nitrate), OC (Organic Carbon), and SO4(Sulfate). 
      The values are for the 2000 year.
